The Slave-Spin Mean-Field (SSMF) approach is a methodology based on solving the Hubbard-Kanamori model based on tight-bindings to obtain the orbital **quasiparticle weights** and **occupations**. 

It is based on the Brinkmann-Rice picture, so that it can trace the evolution of these quantities in terms of U, J<sub>H</sub>, T, total nominal filling; but once the Mott phase is reached (i.e., all quasiparticle weights are 0), then there is not more information. Thus it is a good approach to study how strongly correlated are certain metals: weakly correlated if the quasiparticle weights are 0.7 - 1.0, strongly correlated if the quasiparticle weights are lower than 0.4 - 0.5. It can also reproduce the **orbital-selective Mott transitions**, meaning some orbital quasiparticles weights are zero, while others are finite.
